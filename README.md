All files and folders in this project should be copied to /srv/salt on the Salt Master

So far this project does the following:

Enables and runs the nginx service

nginx service persists after reboot

Creates a webserver.conf file and syncs it with nginx/webserver.conf

webserver.conf file changes the listening port to 3200
